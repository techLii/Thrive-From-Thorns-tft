      "Volunteering as a mentor with Thrive From Thorns Kenya has been life-changing—not just for the youth I work with, but for me as well. I started mentoring a group of teenagers who were struggling with self-confidence and decision-making, guiding them through life skills workshops, career planning, and personal development sessions. One young boy, Joseph, had dropped out of school because he felt he had no future. Over months of mentorship, I watched him rediscover his self-worth, set goals, and even take on leadership roles in his community. TFT doesn’t just teach skills; it transforms mindsets and inspires young people to step boldly into their future.",

    testimonial:
      "I joined TFT to support the sponsorship program, helping children gain access to education and essential resources. I met Grace, a bright 10-year-old girl who had the potential to excel but lacked school fees and learning materials. Through TFT’s sponsorship program, she received full educational support, mentorship, and guidance. Months later, she had not only caught up academically but had become a leader among her peers, mentoring younger students herself. Witnessing the transformative power of sponsorship reinforced why TFT’s model works—it’s about providing more than funds; it’s about giving hope, stability, and the tools for lifelong success.",

    testimonial:
      "Being part of TFT’s economic empowerment programs for families opened my eyes to the power of opportunity. I worked with parents and guardians, helping them learn skills in entrepreneurship, vocational training, and sustainable income generation. One family I worked with had struggled for years to make ends meet. Through training and mentorship, they started a small poultry business, learned financial planning, and began earning enough to support their children’s education. Seeing their pride and independence grow was unforgettable. TFT taught me that empowering families economically doesn’t just alleviate poverty—it restores dignity and strengthens homes.",
